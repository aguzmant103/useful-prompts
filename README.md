## Overview

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI systems. This repository provides a systematic approach to prompt engineering, helping you create prompts that yield consistent, high-quality results.

## Workflow Stages

The prompt engineering workflow consists of the following stages:

1. **Project Description** - Define the scope and purpose of your AI application
2. **Request Prompt** - Create a prompt that clearly defines user input and expected response format
3. **Specification Prompt** - Develop detailed requirements and constraints for the AI system
4. **Planner Prompt** - Design a workflow plan with steps, dependencies, and integration points
5. **Code Generation Prompt** - Create prompts that generate code based on specifications

Each stage has a dedicated template in the `Prompts-Workflow` directory.

## Getting Started

To use this workflow:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the `Prompts-Workflow` directory
3. Follow each prompt template in sequence, starting with `0-DescribeProject Idea.md`
4. Refine your prompts based on the AI responses and your specific requirements

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the workflow or templates are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss potential changes.
